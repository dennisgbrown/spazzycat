# spazzycat

A simple Atari 2600 game heavily based on the "Collect" game by Darrell Spice, Jr; See https://atariage.com/forums/blogs/entry/11157-step-14-add-animation/

In this game, move your humanoid around to collect spazzy cats and accumulate points before time elapses. Avoid the huge colored boxes because touching them deducts from your score.
